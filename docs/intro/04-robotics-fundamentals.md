 # 📙Robotics Fundamentals


## ⚙️ Key Components of a Robot

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🤖 **Manipulator / Effector** | Physical structure interacting with the environment (arm, gripper, wheels, legs). |
| 💪 **Actuators** | The "muscles" that convert energy into motion (electric motors, hydraulic/pneumatic systems). |
| 👁️ **Sensors** | Devices that perceive the environment and internal state (cameras, microphones, touch sensors, IMUs). |
| 🧠 **Controller** | The "brain" of the robot — processes sensor data, executes programs, sends commands. |
| 🔋 **Power Supply** | Provides energy: batteries, outlets, or other energy sources. |

## 🏃 Robot Kinematics and Dynamics

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📐 **Kinematics** | Geometry of motion without considering forces. Includes forward and inverse kinematics. |
| ⚡ **Dynamics** | Relation between motion and forces/torques. Includes mass, inertia, gravity, and their effect on movement. |

## 🤖 Types of Robots

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🏭 **Industrial Robots** | Manufacturing tasks: assembly, welding, painting, material handling. |
| 🚗 **Mobile Robots** | Move around environments: AGVs, drones, humanoids. |
| 🧍 **Humanoid Robots** | Resemble humans; capable of bipedal locomotion and interaction. |
| 🤝 **Collaborative Robots (Cobots)** | Work alongside humans in shared spaces. |
| 🏥 **Medical Robots** | Used for surgery, rehabilitation, medication dispensing. |
