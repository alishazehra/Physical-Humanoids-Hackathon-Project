## 🧩 Key Characteristics

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🤝 **Embodied Intelligence** | AI is integrated into a physical body such as a robot or smart device. |
| 🌍 **Real-world Interaction** | Systems can manipulate objects, navigate spaces, and interact with humans. |
| 🌀 **Sensorimotor Learning** | Machines learn through sensory input and motor actions, similar to humans or animals. |
| 🧠 **Autonomy** | Systems make decisions and act without constant human control. |

## 🎯 Why Physical AI?

The physical world is noisy, unpredictable, and dynamic — something virtual AI cannot fully understand.  
Physical AI bridges this gap and enables applications in:

| Application | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles | Cars navigate roads autonomously. |
| 🦾 Humanoid Robots | Robots interact safely with humans. |
| 🏭 Smart Manufacturing | Automated factories with intelligent machines. |
| 🏥 Healthcare | Surgical robots, patient monitoring systems. |
| 🚀 Exploration | Space and underwater exploration robots. |
