## 🧠 Perception: Making Sense of Data

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🏷️ **Object Recognition / Detection** | Use deep learning (CNNs) to identify and locate objects in images or 3D point clouds. |
| 🏠 **Scene Understanding** | Semantic understanding of environment: floors, walls, tables, chairs. |
| 🗺️ **Localization & Mapping (SLAM)** | Map unknown environments while tracking robot location. |
| 🧍 **Human Pose Estimation** | Detect and track human body parts for safe interaction. |
| 😊 **Emotion Recognition** | Infer human emotional states from facial expressions, body language, and voice. |
